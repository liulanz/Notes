SQL Notes
=============================
- database management systems
	- a special software program that helps users create and maintain a database
		

[Two types of database]
= Relational Databases (SQL)
	- example for relational database system: mySQL
	- Orgranize data into one or more table
		- each table has columns and rows
		- a unique key identifies each rows
	- uses structured query language (SQL)
		- language we can use to interact with those relational database systems
	
		
= NON-relational (noSQL)
	- Key-value stores
	- documents(JSON, XML, etc)
	- Graphs
	- example for relational database system: mongoDB
	
===================================
We use SQL to interact with database management systems
= Query is a set of instructions given to the RDBMS written in SQL that tells the RDBMS what information you want it to retrieve for you
	example: "SELECT employee.name, employee.age FROM employee WHERE employee.salary > 30000;"
